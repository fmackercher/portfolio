                <h3 class="section-title heading-3">Needs Assessment</h3>
                <p class="section-paragraph">Through research and interviews my team identified three primary needs of
                    Detroit students:<br>
                    1. Engaging and interactive learning experiences.<br>
                    2. Connectivity to the cultural center.<br>
                    3. An avenue to contribute their own ideas and creativity within the cultural center.</p>
                <h3 class="section-title heading-3">Vision and Solution</h3>
                <p class="section-paragraph">Our research on the cultural district, technological access, and physical
                    transportation in Detroit
                    and interviews with two high school teachers led to our focus on a digital experience that builds on
                    an understanding of how students use technology to form social connections and have fun utilizing
                    interactive technologies to engage with their community. We drew inspiration from other digital
                    games that allow users to collaborate and be creative such as MineCraft and Fortnite.</p>

                <p class="section-paragraph">Decrypt Detroit is a digitally-based competition spanning the cultural
                    district. The application
                    provides "missions" for students to complete throughout the district, challenging users to visit all
                    of the institutions to complete scavenger hunts and create challenges unique to each location.
                    Scavenger hunts unique to each institution will lead players through each location, and points can
                    be earned by finding and scanning QR codes throughout the institutions.</p>
                <img class="section-image" src="../images/QR_code.jpg" alt="QR Code">
                <p class="section-paragraph">To begin the game, players join a team with their friends or other online
                    users and compete against
                    different teams to complete the most missions and claim ‘zones’ marked by digital displays placed in
                    front of each institution throughout the district. Along the way, players are invited to express
                    their unique perspective on Detroit by sharing photos that respond to historical and cultural
                    prompts.</p>
                <img class="section-image" src="../images/digital_display.jpg" alt="Digital Display">
                <p class="section-paragraph">These prompts invite users to share their own perspective on the city of
                    Detroit and allow
                    their voices to be heard and seen throughout the district. Responses to cultural prompts will be
                    made visible on the digital displays placed outside of each institution. The game culminates in a
                    winning team based on the points earned throughout scavenger hunts and creative challenges in each
                    institution or ‘zone’.</p>
